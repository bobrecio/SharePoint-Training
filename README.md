# SharePoint training guide
by Bob Recio

This guide is my approach at training someone to become a "front-end" SharePoint administrator; without access to the IIS server console or SharePoint Central Admin.

## Background
I've been working with SharePoint since 2003 at various organizations. I've been involved in upgrades all the way back to SharePoint 2002. And in one case, i was involved in reverting back. Even with all that, only once in my SharePoint career have I had to change things using the server or even central admin. I'm not saying that it's not need - that work is absolutely required.
At most of my jobs, we've had server administrators that were part of the systems administration team. It was their job to keep the servers running, configured and apply security updates.
