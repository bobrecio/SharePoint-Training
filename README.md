# SharePoint Training Guide
by Bob Recio

This guide is my approach at training someone to become a "front-end" SharePoint administrator; without access to the IIS server console or SharePoint Central Admin.

## Background
I've been working with SharePoint since 2003 at various organizations. I've been involved in upgrades and migrations all the way back to SharePoint 2002. And in one case, I was involved in reverting an instance to a previous version. Even with all that, only once in my SharePoint career has my job involved managing SharePoint using the server console or even central admin. I'm not saying that it's not needed for SharePoint - that work is absolutely required - however, it is out of scope for what I intend to teach.

At most of my jobs, we've had server administrators that were part of the systems administration team. It was their job to keep the servers running, configured and apply security updates. In many cases, these guys have been scheer geniuses and wizards when it comes to keeping the environment running. Many have gone on to do great things and some have published books on their skills.

Looking back, I've realized that most of the work that I have done has been just supporting the end-users - business users that treat SharePoint as a tool. They just need to store documents or keep a list, and I show them how they can do that using SharePoint. In most cases, I just set up their list or library, then show them how to make additions or changes, and they are on their way. Once they start collecting a lot of content, they usually come back for advice on getting organized. Sometimes they even come back with requests for a "dashboard" - this is usually a page with easy access (links) to their most used content. (Note: In web sites it's usually called a home page - but folks like to call them dashboards, for some reason.)

In essence, my role is just a "super" user. Managing SharePoint sites and lists and libraries is something that any user can do. You don't need any special access to the server or configuration of SharePoint. All that's required is the proper level of permissions on the site and the willingness to understand the capabilities and perform the work required. 

Of course, as with everything else, there are tons of resources available on the Internet about SharePoint. I'm not trying to put another book on the interenet to add to the list. Instead, this writing is intended to be a *guide* to topics that a person might want to learn about in order to become more familiar with SharePoint concepts.

I've found that a good starting point for information, when it comes to most topics, is Wikipedia.org. Here is the article on Wikipedia about SharePoint - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint
